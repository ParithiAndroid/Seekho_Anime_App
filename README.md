## 🧠 Assumptions Made

- The app only displays the top 25 anime for simplicity and performance.
- Anime details include **producer information** instead of cast.
- Trailers are hosted on YouTube, and the video is embedded using WebView (instead of the full YouTube SDK).
- Error handling is basic (e.g., no connection = toast).

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Retrofit & OkHttp** – API requests and networking.
- **Room DB** – Local database.
- **Hilt** – Dependency injection.
- **Picasso** – Image loading.
- **WebView** – Embedding YouTube trailers.
- **Navigation Component** – App navigation.
- **Splash Screen API** – Android 12+ splash experience.
